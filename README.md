# 🃏 English Cue Cards for Conversation Practice

Welcome to **Cue & Converse** – a growing collection of real-life English prompts designed to help learners practice spontaneous conversation. These cue cards are perfect for ESL classrooms, 1-on-1 speaking sessions, or solo practice.

## ✨ What’s Inside

A list of fun, unexpected, and useful speaking prompts like:

- They gave you the wrong drink!
- You want to ask for extra sugar.
- You want to split the bill.
- You’re running late and need to call a friend.
- You left your umbrella at your friend’s place.

💬 Each card helps simulate real-world situations, encouraging learners to *think in English* and respond naturally.

## 🎯 Who It’s For

- English learners at **A1–B1 level**
- ESL teachers looking for class warmups

## 🧩 How to Use

- Print and cut them out
